Updated prompt quality:

{
  "explicit_reasoning": true,
  "structured_output": true,
  "tool_separation": true,
  "conversation_loop": true,
  "instructional_framing": true,
  "internal_self_checks": true,
  "reasoning_type_awareness": true,
  "fallbacks": true,
  "overall_clarity": "Excellent structure and coverage. The prompt now enforces step-by-step reasoning, tags reasoning types, includes self-checks and fallbacks, and provides precise output formatting. Very robust for tool-driven, iterative problem-solving."
