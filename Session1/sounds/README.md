# Custom Alert Sound

To change the alert sound:

1. Convert your desired YouTube video or any other audio to MP3 format
   - You can use online YouTube to MP3 converters
   - Or download the audio and convert it using tools like FFmpeg
   
2. Name your sound file `alert.mp3` and place it in this directory

Requirements:
- File must be named `alert.mp3`
- Keep the file size reasonable (preferably under 1MB)
- Make sure you have the rights to use the audio

Note: The extension will play this sound at maximum volume when you're inactive on Teams!
